# Image Classifier using Transfer Learning

**Project Description:**

This project aims to build an image classifier using transfer learning. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories. This approach is significantly more efficient and requires less data compared to training a CNN from scratch. We'll be using a pre-trained model, fine-tuning it on our specific dataset, and evaluating its performance. This project will be valuable for learning about transfer learning techniques, model optimization, and efficient image classification.

**Dataset:**

We are using the [Dataset Name] dataset, which contains [Number] images across [Number] classes.  The dataset is split into:

* **Training Set:** [Number] images
* **Validation Set:** [Number] images
* **Testing Set:** [Number] images

The dataset can be downloaded from [Link to dataset or instructions to obtain it].  The data is organized with images in subfolders named after their respective classes.  [Optional: Add details about preprocessing steps performed on the dataset, e.g., resizing, normalization].


**Libraries:**

* **TensorFlow/Keras (>=2.10):**  For building and training the neural network model.  This is our primary deep learning framework.
* **NumPy (>=1.24):** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
* **Scikit-learn (>=1.3):** For model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) and potential data preprocessing techniques.
* **Matplotlib (>=3.7):** For visualizing results, such as training curves and confusion matrices.
* **Seaborn (>=0.13):** For enhanced data visualization.
* **Pillow (PIL) (>=9.5):** For image manipulation tasks (resizing, data augmentation).


**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`. Images are resized to [Dimensions] and normalized to a range of [Range, e.g., 0-1]. Data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and zooms are applied to the training set to increase model robustness and prevent overfitting.
2. **Model Selection:** We selected the [Pre-trained Model Name, e.g., ResNet50] model from TensorFlow Hub/Keras Applications as our base model due to its [Reason for selection, e.g., strong performance on image classification tasks and relatively efficient architecture].
3. **Transfer Learning:** The pre-trained model's convolutional base layers are initially frozen to preserve the features learned from its original training dataset.  A custom classification head (fully connected layers) is added on top, with the number of output neurons matching the number of classes in our dataset.
4. **Fine-tuning:** After initial training with the frozen base, we unfreeze the top [Number] layers of the pre-trained model and continue training. This allows the model to fine-tune its features to better suit our specific dataset.
5. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained using the [Optimizer, e.g., Adam] optimizer with a learning rate of [Learning Rate] and the categorical cross-entropy loss function.  Training progress is monitored using accuracy and loss on both the training and validation sets. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.
6. **Testing and Reporting:** The final model is evaluated on the held-out testing set.  Key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix, are calculated and visualized to assess the model's performance.
